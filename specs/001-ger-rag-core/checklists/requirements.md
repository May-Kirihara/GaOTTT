# Specification Quality Checklist: GER-RAG Core Retrieval System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- Dynamic scoring formula in FR-005 describes behavior (what the system computes), not implementation (how it is coded). Retained as it is essential for unambiguous specification of the feature's core logic.
- Clarification session (2026-03-27): 5 questions asked and resolved — concurrency strategy, ID generation, authentication, crash recovery, negative score handling. All integrated into spec.
