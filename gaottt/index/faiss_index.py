        Writes to ``path.tmp`` first, then ``os.replace`` to the final
        location. ``os.replace`` is atomic on POSIX and on Windows
        (Python 3.3+), so a kill / crash mid-write leaves the previous
        valid file at ``path`` intact — the partial write only damages
        the orphan ``.tmp`` file, which the next save overwrites.

        Why: the previous implementation called ``faiss.write_index``
        directly against ``path``, truncating the existing file before
        the new contents were fully written. A SIGTERM/SIGKILL during
        the ~100 MB write of a 30k-vector index left ``gaottt.faiss`` /
        ``gaottt.virtual.faiss`` as 0-byte stubs that the next startup
        could not load (``Error: 'ret == (1)' failed: read error``).
        Observed twice on 2026-05-14 during routine backend restarts;
        the virtual_faiss_save_loop fires every 60 s, so any kill
        roughly during that window risks corruption.
