"""GaOTTT MCP Server — AI Agent Long-Term Memory (formerly GER-RAG)

Provides gravitational displacement-powered memory for AI agents.
Phase R4 will reframe the philosophy as "TTT framework that happens to look like RAG".

Usage:
    # stdio (legacy — every agent spawns its own subprocess and a full engine)
    python -m gaottt.server.mcp_server

    # streamable-HTTP (recommended — one long-lived process, N clients
    # connect over HTTP. Avoids the per-agent ×N RAM cost and the
    # bidirectional cache-overwrite trap)
    python -m gaottt.server.mcp_server --transport streamable-http --port 7878

    # SSE (older HTTP transport; supported but streamable-http is preferred)
    python -m gaottt.server.mcp_server --transport sse --port 7878

Clients (with --transport streamable-http) point at
``http://127.0.0.1:7878/mcp``. See Operations-Server-Setup.md for the
.mcp.json / opencode.json snippets and a systemd unit example.

    """Search long-term memory with gravitational wave propagation.

    Gravity waves propagate recursively through the knowledge space.
    High-mass memories attract more neighbors, creating wider gravitational fields.

    By default this transparently consumes any matching prefetch entry —
    if `prefetch(query, top_k)` was called recently, the result is returned
    instantly. Pass `force_refresh=True` to bypass the prefetch cache and
    re-run the full wave simulation.

    **Phase J Stage 2 — explicit pool injection** (`persona_context` /
    `tag_filter`): the seed step pulls FAISS top-K *and* unions in every
    node matching the caller's explicit filters, bypassing
    `source_filter` restrictions. Use this when you need to surface a
    memo whose embedding is far from the query — e.g., a tag-tied cohort
    in a different language or vocabulary from the query.

    **Embeddings are not cross-lingual.** RURI is a Japanese-specialized
    model: a query mostly retrieves memories written in the SAME language
    as the query — an English query surfaces English memories, a Japanese
    query surfaces Japanese ones; it does not bridge the two. Cosine stays
    in a narrow high band either way, so a language mismatch fails
    *silently* (no error, no low score). Write the query in the language
    of the memories you expect to find; when query and target differ in
    language, fall back to `tag_filter` / `source_filter` to inject the
    target explicitly.

    Args:
        query: Search query
        top_k: Number of results (default 5)
        source_filter: Restrictive — only ``metadata.source`` matches survive
                       the seed pool (Phase H Stage 2). Use for sparse class
                       carve-out like ``["agent"]``.
        wave_depth: Override recursion depth (default from config)
        wave_k: Override initial seed count (default from config)
        force_refresh: Bypass prefetch cache (default False)
        persona_context: Explicit list of declared value/intention/commitment
                         IDs. Overrides Stage 1 auto-detect for proximity
                         calculation *and* additively injects these IDs into
                         the seed pool (Phase J Stage 2).
        tag_filter: Substring list (OR match) of ``metadata.tags`` entries.
                    Every matching node is additively injected into the seed
                    pool, even if it is distant in embedding space. Bypasses
                    ``source_filter`` (caller's explicit ask wins).
        output_mode: Controls how much content is returned per result.
                     "full" (default) — complete content, backward-compatible.
                     "compact" — content truncated at 300 chars; use when you
                     only need to scan/triage results before deciding which to
                     read in full. Saves significant tokens on large recalls.
                     "ids" — header line only (id, scores, tags), no content;
                     use when you only need to know which memories exist.
        auto_route: Phase O Stage 3 — when True (default), the service
                    detects queries phrased as structured aspect questions
                    (e.g. "現在 active な commitment", "持っている value") and
                    runs the matching ``reflect`` aspect in parallel. The
                    summary is appended to the response so you do not have to
                    switch to ``reflect`` manually. Pass False to suppress for
                    this call (debugging, or you want pure free-form recall).
        mode: Phase O Stage 4 — content economy.
              "detail" (default) — full content per result.
              "list" — content truncated to 80 chars (newline-stripped) so 20
              results fit in the budget one full result would consume. Pair
              with ``top_k=20, output_mode="full"`` for a scannable index;
              follow up with a targeted ``recall(...)`` on the id you care
              about for the full payload.
        passive: Ambient Recall — when True the search runs but the gravity
                 field is NOT perturbed: no mass update, no query-attraction
                 displacement, no co-occurrence edges. Use for automatic /
                 background recall (the Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook
                 calls this) so ambient queries never become an uncontrolled
                 TTT signal. Default False keeps recall a training step.

      ▼ gravitational lensing — a memory textually *far* from the query that

        gravity field *learned*, which no plain embedding search would surface
      ▼ ⚠ contradiction — surfaced ``contradicts``-edge pairs
      ▼ persona — an active declared value/intention, for grounding

    Every entry carries provenance metadata (source · certainty · age) so the
    reader can weigh stale / low-certainty memories accordingly.

    This is what the Claude Code ``UserPromptSubmit`` hook calls every turn —
    it lets long-term memory surface *without* the model having to call
    ``recall`` explicitly. Always passive: it never perturbs the gravity
    field.

    Relevance gate: a word-level (Sudachi) BM25 "strong-match" gate decides
    whether to inject — only prompts that strongly match stored content fire.
    When nothing clears it the result is the sentinel ``(関連する記憶なし)``
    (no block), so ambient injection stays silent on off-topic / weak prompts.

        min_score: Threshold for the *fallback* virtual_score gate only — used

                   gate is tuned server-side (``config.ambient_bm25_min_score``).
        exclude_tags: Substrings; a memory whose tags contain ANY of them is
                   dropped from direct / lensing / persona candidates before
                   slot composition. Use to keep ``smoke-test`` and similar
                   test artifacts out of ambient injection without deleting
                   them from the corpus (production hook usually forwards
                   ``GAOTTT_AMBIENT_EXCLUDE_TAGS``).

                   surfaced (Refinement Stage 3 — Phase O Stage 1 ScoreBreakdown
                   at ambient granularity). Default off to preserve the
